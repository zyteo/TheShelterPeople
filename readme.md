# TheShelterPeople_sg

Animal Shelter Website for TheShelterPeople.

Even though the volunteer group has since been disbanded as of 2023, I keep this website up as a reminder of the cats.

## Description

This Animal Shelter website was refined from the prototype that was created for a project.

*Extremely big* special shout out to my wonderful group mates (They the MVPs!!), without whom this website would not be possible! Check out the prototype's github [here.](https://github.com/soniasltan/Project-3---The-Shelter-People)
